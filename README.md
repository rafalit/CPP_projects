# LAB2: Using Classes Corresponding to Operating Systems - Windows, Linux, MacOS
The goal of this task is to practice using classes and, at the same time, understand/remind/complete significant differences between operating systems from a programming perspective for different systems.

# LAB3: Inheritance and Interactions Between Objects in a 2D Game
The objective of this task is to practice using classes and apply inheritance in programming. Additionally, it involves interactions between objects, all demonstrated through a 2D game example.

# LAB4: Memory Management and Text Operations with the SimpleString Class
This task focuses on practicing memory allocation, text manipulation, as well as constructors and destructors, using the example of the SimpleString class.

# LAB5: Comparison of Basic Containers in C++
The aim of this task is to compare standard containers, delve into the differences between them, and experiment with their functionalities. Some required operations are provided by a given container, but not all, prompting the consideration of reasons behind this.

# LAB6: Shapes Drawing
This task involves using polymorphism in C++ correctly, considering necessary elements, and creating a simple implementation that enables drawing complex shapes through a fascinating composition.

# LAB7: 2x2 Matrix - Operator Overloading Example
Operator overloading on the example of a 2x2 matrix. The task is to create a user-friendly type for operations on a 2x2 matrix called TwoDimensionMatrix, with appropriate constructors, methods, and overloaded operators.

# LAB8-9: Singly Linked List with Unique Elements Wrapping double and std::string in Hierarchy + Parser + Casting + Exceptions
This task involves creating a program from start to finish that performs a specific function. This could be a parser for standard output responding to commands, similar to a notebook with a history.

# LAB13: Matrix Stored in Binary File
The goal of this task is to:
- Practice using templates (including defining methods outside the class).
- Practice creating iterators (with the option to comment out the macro UNDEFINED_FILE_MATRIX_ITERATOR).
- Practice file operations (including binary files).
